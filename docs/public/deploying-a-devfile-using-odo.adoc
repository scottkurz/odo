== Introduction to devfile

What is a devfile?

A https://devfile.github.io/devfile/index.html[devfile] is a portable file that describes your development environment. It allows reproducing a _portable_ developmental environment without the need of reconfiguration.

With a devfile you can describe:

* Development components such as container definition for build and application runtimes
* A list of pre-defined commands that can be run
* Projects to initially clone

odo takes this devfile and transforms it into a workspace of multiple containers running on Kubernetes or OpenShift.

Devfiles are YAML files with a defined https://devfile.github.io/devfile/_attachments/api-reference.html[schema].

== odo and devfile

odo can now create components from devfiles as recorded in registries. odo automatically consults the https://github.com/odo-devfiles/registry[default registry] but users can also add their own registries. Devfiles contribute new component types that users can pull to begin development immediately.

An example deployment scenario:

. `odo create` will consult the recorded devfile registries to offer the user a selection of available component types and pull down the associated `devfile.yaml` file
. `odo push` parses and then deploys the component in the following order:
 .. Parses and validates the YAML file
 .. Deploys the development environment to your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster
 .. Synchronizes your source code to the containers
 .. Executes any prerequisite commands

== Deploying your first devfile

=== Ingress Setup 

You will need to provide an ingress domain name for the services you create with odo, which you will specify via the `--host` argument with `odo url create`.

An easy way to do this is to use the https://nip.io/[nip.io] service to create host names mapping to the external IP of your ingress controller service. 

In the commands below we assume you are using the https://nip.io/[nip.io] service and https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/[minikube], e.g.: 

[source,sh]
----
  $ odo url create --host $(minikube ip).nip.io
----

===== Minikube Cluster Ingress Setup

Enable the ingress addon in minikube. 

[source,sh]
----
  $ minikube addons enable ingress
----

With Minikube running in a virtual machine, the ingress controller IP address is obtained via `minikube ip` (the value is `192.168.99.100` in the sample output shown below).

===== OpenShift Cluster Ingress Setup

For link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview[CodeReady Containers] running in a virtual machine, for example, you can get it by `crc ip`.
Note you might not need to use the ingress in OpenShift, where you can use routes instead.

===== Ingress Notes

Of course there are other options but this approach avoids the need to edit the `/etc/hosts/` file with each created service URL.

Checkout this https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[document] to know more about ingress.

=== First Steps

* Login to your cluster (unnecessary if you've used other standard methods, e.g. kubectl to establish the current context)
+
[source,sh]
----
  $ odo login -u developer -p developer
----
* Create a project to keep your source code, tests, and libraries organized in a separate single unit.
+
[source,sh]
----
  $ odo project create myproject
   ✓  Project 'myproject' is ready for use
   ✓  New project created and now using project : myproject
----

== Listing all available devfile components

* Before deploying your first component, have a look at what is available:
+
[source,sh]
----
  $ odo catalog list components

In our example, we will be using `java-springboot` to deploy a sample https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Springboot] component.

== Deploying a Java Spring Boot® component to a Kubernetes / OpenShift cluster

In this example we will be deploying an https://github.com/odo-devfiles/springboot-ex[example Spring Boot® component] that uses https://maven.apache.org/install.html[Maven] and Java 8 JDK.

+
[source,sh]
----
 $ cd <directory-name>
